        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Gabriel Urquidez. I am part Indigenous and part Basque. I was born in the small southwestern town of Hobbs, NM. After my mother passed in 1983, I moved to Northern California and grew up in San Jose, CA. I was fortunate enough to attend UC Davis, where I earned my BA in Philosophy. I always thought I wanted to be a lawyer, but once I did some law internship work, I realized writing VCR instructions wasn't for me. After 9/11, I decided to serve my country and enlisted in the Navy. After 20 years, I retired. During those 20 years, I got married and had 3 amazing daughters. I earned two masters degrees in Healthcare Admin and Network Operations & Technology. I am currently in the process of moving back to California from Texas. I hope to be there by Thanksgiving.
